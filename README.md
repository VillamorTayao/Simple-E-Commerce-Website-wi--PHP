# Simple E-commerce Website
- it is a project for getting to familiarize on basics of PHP while using MySQL for database
- It is a recreation of my past project for one of my subjects while still in college


NOTE: This project is still a work in progress and not yet fully finished
## Tools used:
- HTML - for structuring the website
- CSS - for styling
- JavaScript- for some user responsive features
- PHP - used for connecting MySQL to the website and allowed implementation of Sign Up/Login, and Contact/Feedback Form
- XAMPP - for localhost testing
- MySQL - for database queries and storage of accounts and contact/feedback messages

## Things I'm still trying to implement now
- Implementation of being able to select products and store them into database
